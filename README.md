# evolucao_basquete

## Description
I play basketball occasionally and I wanted to maintain a record of how much do I play, what grade would I give for the game and how much had I played.
For this, I am currently using notion, and it is a good tool but I wanted to gather its information to display on a dashboard, where I could keep track of all the info I wanted.
This project comes in handy as it helps me connecting the notion database that I update everytime I play.
